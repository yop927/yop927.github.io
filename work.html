	<br><strong>NARA (National Archives and Records Administration (June ~ August, 2016)</strong></br>
	<br> -Worked on a team of 4, and there were 3 teams in total. Each team was required to read certain number of box <br> that contains multiple files that were written during the World War 2. The documents were about the battle between <br> the U.S. and Japan on Pacific Islands. Our job was to take pictures if we find any information about the soldiers,<br> then sorted the information based on the battlefield location, grid number or name of the troop on the Excel sheet.
